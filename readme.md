Project's Title: "Postgres assignment"

Project's Description: In this project, I have created 2 APIs, one for restaurant registration and another to get restaurant details by applying various filters.

Approach:

--I have created an index file, in which I have imported express framework, body-parser for parsing request body and dotenv for securing important keys.
--I have used express routing to create a mini-app, named route, in which i have created both API.
--I have used sequilize to apply CRUD operation related queries on postgres database.
--User controller has two handlers where business logic is kept for both the APIs.
--To validate each field of request headers, I have imported validator functions from utility directory.

```
